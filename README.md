# Elasticsearch with Ruby
> Minor POC to generate API mocks from log entries

## Motivation

Given a sequence of entries in elasticsearch
I want to be able to collect data about request and response on pre-production environment
In order to generate API mocks for automated tests

## Roadmap

- ~environment with docker-compose~
- ~collect data from elasticsearch~
- generate mock files like [Wiremock](http://wiremock.org/docs/running-standalone/)
